# Learning Swift

This repo contains several projects that I have built to help be learn and better understand Swift, Xcode, and mobile app development.

The app I am currently working on is a clone of the Instagram app, with backend data being hosted on Firebase.

You can watch a video demo of this app here: [Instagram Clone â€“ YouTube]()
